                <img src="images/basic-html.jpg"/></a>
                <p>For the Basic HTML assignment, I created a website that goes over the sport of equestrianism. It includes elements such as a table, images, and paragraphs. The table goes into the different types of riding and the gear used for those types. Broader information is also included, such as the varieties of riding and benefits of it.</p>

                <img src="images/basic-css.jpg"/></a>
                <p>For the Basic CSS assignment, I went more in depth in terms of the style. There is a background image, navigation bar with the hover feature, a color palette, and borders. A table was included in this website as well as style features such as background color, text color, and content alignment.</p>

                <p>For the Page Layout assignment, I utilized style features, flexbox, and media query to achieve a provided website layout. The website features various colors, alignments, and elements to achieve the landscape and vertical layout.</p>

                <img src="images/javascript.jpg"></a>
                <p>For the Introduction to JavaScript assignment, I created a website with 3 columns, a header, and subheader. Each of the columns were unique as to the functions they perform using JavaScript. Column 1 was a counter, column 2 was a image refresher, and column 3 was a image slider. I was able to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS all together.</p>

                <img src="images/project1.jpg"></a>
                <p>For the Topic Selection, I created a PDF outlining my website. I covered what the website is, what it is about, what it will cover, and the pages. I also included data descriptions about each tab, and administrative notes. The PDF will help outline what the website will look like.</p>

                <img src="images/project2.jpg"></a>
                <p>For the Wireframe, I created a mock creation of what my website will physically look like. I was able to layout what each tab will look like, and how everything will be spaced out and organized. This will make the creative aspect of building the website flow easily when creating.</p>

                <p>For the HTML and CSS, I create the outline of my website. I created the html and css aspects of it to make sure the layout was ideal. Not a ton of thought was put into the looks of the website yet, this is yet to come. However, having the bones of everything will help make sure I am on the right track.</p>
